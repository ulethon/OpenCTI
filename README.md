## Overview

Octi is designed to automate the process of collecting, transforming, and ingesting threat intelligence data into OpenCTI. The repository includes:
- **Connectors**: Pre-built connectors for multiple threat intelligence platforms.
- **Data Ingestion Python Script**: A Python-based script that ingests the collected data into OpenCTI.
- **OpenCTI Configuration Files**: YML and environment configuration files needed to set up OpenCTI integration.
  
## Connectors

The repository contains connectors for various threat intelligence platforms. These connectors allow seamless integration with OpenCTI to automatically pull data from external sources. Connectors include:
- **[Connector 1 Name]**: Description of what it connects to.
- **[Connector 2 Name]**: Description of what it connects to.
- **[Connector 3 Name]**: Description of what it connects to.
  
Each connector is self-contained in its own folder with:
- The connector script (typically in Python).
- Documentation for installation and usage.
  
Data Ingestion

The Python script provided here automates the ingestion of the data collected from the connectors into OpenCTI. The script:

    Pulls data from the configured connectors.
    Transforms and cleans the data into a format that OpenCTI understands.
    Uses the OpenCTI API to push the data into your OpenCTI instance.

How to Use the Data Ingestion Script

    Ensure that all required connectors are properly set up and data is available.
    Modify the ingestion_config.yml file to specify the data sources and OpenCTI API details.
    Run the Python ingestion script as follows:
    python ingestion_script.py

The script will automatically connect to OpenCTI and ingest the data.
Example Directory Structure
/data_ingestion/
  ├── ingestion_script.py
  ├── ingestion_config.yml
  └── requirements.txt
  
OpenCTI Configuration

To configure OpenCTI with your environment, a configuration YAML file is included (opencti_config.yml). This file contains the necessary setup for connecting to your OpenCTI instance, as well as other settings for the ingestion process.
Example of opencti_config.yml
opencti_url: "https://your-opencti-instance.com"
opencti_api_token: "your_api_token_here"
data_sources:
  - source_name: "connector_1"
    url: "https://data-source-1.com/api"
    api_key: "source_1_api_key"
  - source_name: "connector_2"
    url: "https://data-source-2.com/api"
    api_key: "source_2_api_key"

The file should be customized based on your OpenCTI instance and the specific data sources you wish to use.
Environment Configuration

This repository also includes an .env file for environment variables. This file contains sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and OpenCTI instance tokens. It is important to keep this file secure and not share it publicly.
Example of .env File
OPENCTI_URL=https://your-opencti-instance.com
OPENCTI_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
SOURCE_1_API_KEY=source_1_api_key
SOURCE_2_API_KEY=source_2_api_key

Ensure that you fill in your real values for these variables before using the ingestion script or connectors.
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
    OpenCTI instance: You need to have an OpenCTI instance set up and running. You can follow the OpenCTI installation guide if needed.
    API Access: Ensure that you have valid API tokens and access to the OpenCTI instance.

Steps to Set Up

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/octi.git
    cd octi
Install the required Python dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the .env file and opencti_config.yml with your environment variables and OpenCTI details.
Ensure your connectors are set up as described in the Connectors section.
Run the ingestion script to begin the data ingestion process:
  python data_ingestion/ingestion_script.py

Usage

Once the setup is complete, the system will automatically pull data from the configured connectors and ingest it into OpenCTI. The ingestion process can be run manually or scheduled to run at regular intervals using cron jobs or task schedulers.
